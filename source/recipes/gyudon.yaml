  - rice
  - with rice
cuisine: japanese
ingredients:
  - 750g thinly sliced beef strips
  - 2 onions, thinly sliced into long strips
  - 3 cups boiling water
  - 2 teaspoons dashi powder
  - 90ml soy sauce
  - 90ml mirin
  - 45ml sake
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 5 eggs, lightly beaten
  - pinch MSG
  - rice
  - spring onion, sliced (garnish, optional)
  - pickled ginger (garnish, optional)
instructions:
  - Put the rice cooker on in advance.
  - In a pot combine water, dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sake, msg and sugar. Stir until disolved.
  - Once simmering, add onions and cook until soft.
  - Next, add the meat, stir occasionally and cook. It'll be done quick, couple minutes.
  - Next, slowly pour the eggs over the top, distributing evenly. Chuck the lid on so the eggs cook and steam for a minute.
  - Serve over rice and eat immediately. Garnish with spring onion and/or pickled ginger.
notes:
  - You might choose to replace pouring the egg in, with instead serving the meal with a fried egg on top for each bowl.
  - I think this might be great with lamb slices too
  - For the sliced meat, easiest way is to buy the hot pot/sukiyaki/bulgogi meat from freezer section of asian grocer, but has higher fat content. Healthier to buy leaner meat and slice yourself.
