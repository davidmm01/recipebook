cuisine: western
ingredients:
  - 600g fish fillets
  - 60g unsalted butter
  - 1/2 cup cooking cream
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 30ml dijon mustard
  - 1 lemon, juiced
  - Salt & pepper
  - fresh parsley, chopped (garnish)
  - 1 lemon, cut into wedges (garnish)
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 200Â°C (all oven types).
  - Place fish in a baking dish - ensure the fish isn't crammed in too snugly. See video or photos in post. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper.
  - Place butter, cream, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a microwave proof jug or bowl. Microwave in 2 x 30 sec bursts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.
  - Sprinkle fish with shallots, then pour over sauce.
  - Bake for 10 - 12 minutes, or until fish is just cooked. Remove from oven and transfer fish to serving plates. Spoon over sauce, and garnish with parsley and lemon wedges if using.
notes:
  - Great served with mashed potatoes or rice to soak up the sauce
  - Used frozen whiting fillets from Aldi for this and it worked great, note this goes directly against the advise on recipetineats website, so YMMV.
