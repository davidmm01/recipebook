ingredients:
    # Chicken
  - 160g natural yogurt
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 teaspoon chilli powder
  - 1 teaspoon garam masala
  - 4 garlic cloves, grated
  - 1 inch ginger, grated
  - 8 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed
    # Curry
  - 3 tablespoons sunflower oil
  - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
  - 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 4 onions, finely chopped
  - 1 400g tin diced tomatoes
  - 2 teaspoons ground coriander
  - 1/2 teaspoon grounc cumin
  - 1 teaspoon garam masala
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
  - 1 teaspoon chilli powder
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 handful of fresh coriander, finely chopped
instructions:
  - Combine the yogurt with the salt, spices, garlic, and ginger in a bowl, and mix well. Add the chicken thighs and make sure that the chicken is coated well in the yogurt marinade. Let it rest overnight, or 1 hour at least, in the fridge.
  - Heat the oil in a pan. Add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds and bay leaf. Once they start to sizzle, add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, until a lovely golden color. Now add the tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes, until softened. Add the spices and salt, and cook for 1 minute. Add the marinated chicken, mix well, and cover. Cook for 40 to 45 minutes over low heat until the chicken is cooked through.
  - Once you have cooked the curry, let it rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This makes the curry really intense and the chicken soaks up the flavors better. Sprinkle with some coriander and serve.
