cuisine: thai
ingredients:
  - 1.5kg lamb shanks (5 small, 4 medium, 2 - 3 large)
  - 114g/ 4oz Maesri Massaman curry paste (1 can), or other brand (Note 1)
  - 400ml coconut milk, full fat (Ayam brand is best, Note 3)
  - 2 cups chicken stock/broth
  - 1 onion
  - 400g small potatoes
  - 1 star anise
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - Red chilli, finely sliced (garnish)
  - Coriander (garnish)
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan).
  - Mix curry paste, coconut milk and stock in a baking dish. Add onion, potato, star anise, cinnamon and lamb.
  - Turn shanks to coat in sauce, then cover with foil.
  - Bake in oven for 2 hours. Remove foil, bake for a further 1 hour (small shanks) or 1.5 hrs (medium to large shanks), turning lamb twice to brown evenly, until meat is so tender it can easily be teased apart with 2 forks.
  - Remove lamb onto plate. Carefully skim off excess fat off the surface (tilt dish, it's easier) - I get about 1/3 cup. Mix sauce in baking dish - it should be reduced down to a syrupy thickness (Note 6).
  - Serve lamb with sauce over jasmine rice, garnished with chilli and coriander.
notes:
  - 1. This recipe is not suited to slow cooker, pressure cooker or stove. Achieving the intended flavour with such little effort requires the oven to caramelise the surface of the lamb and sauce (as well as reducing the sauce).
  - 2. Massaman curry paste - best is Maesri brand, sold at most Woolworths & Coles in Australia. Ayam i tried and good (i put the whole can).
  - 3. Coconut milk - the quality/flavour comes down to the % of the liquid that is actually coconut milk. Ayam is the highest at 89%, cheap ones can be as low as 45%.
