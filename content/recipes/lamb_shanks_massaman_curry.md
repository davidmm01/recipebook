## Ingredients
- 1.5kg lamb shanks (5 small, 4 medium, 2 - 3 large)
- 114g/ 4oz Maesri Massaman curry paste (1 can), or other brand (Note 1)
- 400ml coconut milk, full fat (Ayam brand is best, Note 3)
- 2 cups chicken stock/broth
- 1 onion
- 400g small potatoes
- 1 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Red chilli, finely sliced (garnish)
- Coriander (garnish)

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan).
- Mix curry paste, coconut milk and stock in a baking dish. Add onion, potato, star anise, cinnamon and lamb.
- Turn shanks to coat in sauce, then cover with foil.
- Bake in oven for 2 hours. Remove foil, bake for a further 1 hour (small shanks) or 1.5 hrs (medium to large shanks), turning lamb twice to brown evenly, until meat is so tender it can easily be teased apart with 2 forks.
- Remove lamb onto plate. Carefully skim off excess fat off the surface (tilt dish, it's easier) - I get about 1/3 cup. Mix sauce in baking dish - it should be reduced down to a syrupy thickness (Note 6).
- Serve lamb with sauce over jasmine rice, garnished with chilli and coriander.
