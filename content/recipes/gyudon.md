## Ingredients
- 750g thinly sliced beef strips
- 2 onions, thinly sliced into long strips
- 3 cups boiling water
- 2 teaspoons dashi powder
- 90ml soy sauce
- 90ml mirin
- 45ml sake
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 5 eggs, lightly beaten
- pinch MSG
- rice
- spring onion, sliced (garnish, optional)

## Instructions
- Put the rice cooker on in advance.
- In a pot combine water, dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sake, msg and sugar. Stir until disolved.
- Once simmering, add onions and cook until soft.
- Next, add the meat, stir occasionally and cook. It'll be done quick, couple minutes.
