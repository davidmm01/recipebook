## Ingredients
- 3 * 500g packs dumpling wrappers (gyoza, wonton etc...)
- 1kg pork mince, 5% fat
- 10 Dried Shiitake Mushrooms, rehydrated and finely chopped
- 15g Ginger, grated
- 2 cups Green Cabbage (half cabbage), finely chopped
- 8 green onions, sliced
- 1 can sliced Water Chestnuts (~133g drained), diced
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 2 Tbsp Sesame Oil
- 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 1 tsp Sugar
- 2 Tbsp Cornstarch
- 1/2 Cup Water

## Instructions
- In a large bowl, combine all the filling mixture ingredients
- Create a cornstarch slurry and add it to the mixture and combine well
- Fill dumpling wrappers. Assuming you buy the usual gyoza/wonton wrappers, each dumpling wrapper is 12g. Add 15g of filling in the centre of the wrapper, then wet the edges and press them together to seal the mixture inside. Crimp the edges and repeat.
- To boil - boil for 5 to 8 minutes. Bit longer if frozen.
- To pan fry - pan fry on one side for a few minutes till a nice colour is developed. Then add some water and cover with a lid, steaming the tops.
- To freeze - place on trays or separated with glad wrap in the freezer so nothing sticks together. Then after an hour or two, combine them into desired size bags, they won't stick together.
