## Ingredients
- 600g fish fillets
- 60g unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup cooking cream
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 30ml dijon mustard
- 1 lemon, juiced
- Salt & pepper
- fresh parsley, chopped (garnish)
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges (garnish)

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 200Â°C (all oven types).
- Place fish in a baking dish - ensure the fish isn't crammed in too snugly. See video or photos in post. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper.
- Place butter, cream, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a microwave proof jug or bowl. Microwave in 2 x 30 sec bursts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.
- Sprinkle fish with shallots, then pour over sauce.
- Bake for 10 - 12 minutes, or until fish is just cooked. Remove from oven and transfer fish to serving plates. Spoon over sauce, and garnish with parsley and lemon wedges if using.
