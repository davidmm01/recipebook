## Ingredients
- ~600g assorted chopped vegetables (think snow peas, eggplant, asparagus, carrot, green beans, zuchinni) etc
- 150g onion
- 20g garlic
- 10g ginger
- 1.2kg chicken breast, diced (or anything else)
- 500ml chicken stock
- 400ml can coconut milk (full fat, ayam is good)
- 195g ayam thai green curry paste jar
- 2tsp sugar
- 6tsp fish sauce

## Instructions
- In oil, cook onions until soft/transulscent.
- Add curry paste, ginger, garlic, let simmer and cook for a bit
- Add the chicken and cook it in the curry paste mixture, tossing a bit. Just a few minutes to give some colour and sear the outside.
- Add in stock, coconut milk, sugar and fish sauce.
- Now we will simmer for 20 minutes and we will be ready to eat. Simmer the vegetables for some of that 20minutes depending on how thick you cut them and what they are. Or just dump them all in and forget - it will be fine.
