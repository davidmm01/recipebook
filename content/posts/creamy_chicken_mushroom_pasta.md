## Ingredients
- 1kg chicken breast, cubed
- 500g mushrooms, sliced
- 280g fresh spinach leaves
- 1 340ml carnation creamy evaporated milk
- 500g pasta, farfalline, farfalle, penne etc
- 3tbsp olive oil
- 2 onions
- 5 garlic cloves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1L chicken broth
- salt
- pepper
- 50g grated parmesan

## Instructions
- Heat 2tbsp olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper. Cook through and set aside.
- Add 1tbsp olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes.
- Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season.
- Add chicken broth and evaporated milk to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the pasta.
- Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from clumping together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.)
- When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down and incorporates.
- Add parmesan and stir until it's well-incorporated and you're left with a smooth sauce.
- Top off with extra parmesan and serve.
