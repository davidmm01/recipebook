## Instructions

- Add the spices to the onion and garlic, waking up the spices. Add a splash of water if its looking dry like it might burn
- add the beans and cook for a minute
- cover the beans with water and cook for further 20 mins or so
- once the water has reduced and the beans are nice and soft, mash them to your preferred level of mashedness (i like it like 75% mashed)
- adjust thickness by cooking longer, or by adding more water
