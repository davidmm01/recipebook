## Ingredients
- 6 carrots (~640g) chopped
- 6 celery (~690g) chopped
- 3 medium onions (~280g) chopped
- 60ml EVOO
- 1kg beef mince (10% fat)
- 1kg pork mince (5% fat)
- 2L passata
- 2 cans crushed tomatos
- 300g tomato paste
- 1.5tsp white sugar
- 1 good pinch MSG
- 500ml red wine
- salt and pepper

## Instructions
- Place a large pot  on medium heat, add EVOO and once warm, add onion. Cook until soft.
- Add carrots and celery.  Leave to cook for 10 minutes.
- Add 250ml of the red wine and leave to simmer on low until the alcohol evaporates.
- Add the mince and break it down before seasoning with salt and pepper.
- Leave mince to brown and excess water to evaporate.
- Mix in the remaining 250ml of wine.
- After allowing the wine to evaporate again, mix through the passata, tomato paste and peeled tomatoes.
- After 1.5hr, add 1L water to the pot and mix through.
- Then after another hour or so, add more. When the sauce looks dry, add water, this will thicken the mixture and allow the mince to become more tender.
- Allow the sauce to bubble only a small amount and not spurt everywhere.
- After around 4 or 5 hours, the sauce will be good. Season with salt.
