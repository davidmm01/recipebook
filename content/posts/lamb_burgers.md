## Ingredients
- 500g lamb mince
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large egg

- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- zest of 1/2 lemon
- 1 teaspoon Rosemary
- 1 small onion, grated or very finely chopped

## Instructions
- In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined.
- Using your hands, shape the mixture into four patties.
- The lamb patties should take around 4minutes each side, cooking closer to high so we get some nice browning.
