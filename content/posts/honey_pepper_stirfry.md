## Ingredients
- 100ml soy sauce
- 60g honey
- 70g tbsp Oyster sauce (sub Hoisin)
- 3 tbsp Chinese cooking wine , Mirin or dry sherry (Note 2)
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tsp coarsely crushed black pepper (or 1/2 tsp normal ground black pepper)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 500g thinly sliced beef steak
- 1 carrot, julienned
- 1 head broccoli, cut to small floretts
- 450g tofu, cut into cubes

## Instructions
- Mix the Sauce ingredients in a bowl.
- Steam the broccoli and carrot for a couple mins in the microwave
- Heat some oil in a wok or large heavy based skillet over high heat until it is smoking.
- Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 minute or until the onion becomes translucent. Keep it moving so the garlic doesn't burn.
- Add the beef and stir fry for 1 minute until just cooked to your liking, then remove into bowl.
- Turn the heat down to medium high, pour in Sauce - it will start simmering very quickly! Let it cook for 1 minute or so until it becomes syrupy - the bubbles will be larger and caramel colour.
- Add the tofu in and let it warm
- Add the vegetables, beef and onion back into the wok, along with any juices pooled on the plate. Toss in the sauce until just warmed through - 1 minute at most. Don't overcook the beef - that would be tragic!
- Serve with rice
