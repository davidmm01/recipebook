  - Boil the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Set aside in a colander.
  - Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet, grill pan, or frying pan over medium high heat. Sear the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Set aside on a plate.

usage:
  - string
notes:
  - Also excellent without any meat as a side dish
  - Would work great with any meat, but particularly beef
next:
  - We haven't actually tried this with the chicken yet, do that!
