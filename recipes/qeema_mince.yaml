  - Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it changes from pink to light brown. Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT water. Cook for a further 2 minutes to let the spices bloom.
  - Add water, stir, then put a loose lid on and cook for 10 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and let it simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated.

notes:
  - Great for meal prep - serve with rice, steamed brocolli and a boiled egg.
  - Also works with chicken or pork
  - consider adding a can of chickpeas just after the meat is mostly browned for some veg and fiber
  - would go good with raita
