instructions:

  - Scramble the eggs, season lightly with salt and pepper
  - In a pan with some oil, cook the eggs until just done, fluffy, moist. Take them off and put aside.
  - Clean out the pan, then again with some oil, cook the garlic and half the spring onion for a minute.
  - Add the prawns.
  - When the prawns are almost done, add the sauce we made earlier and the tomatos. Cook until they have broken down and a release the juice.
  - Make a slurry by combining the corn starch and water, and add it. Stir until thickened
  - Add in the scrambled eggs.
  - Plate ontop of rice, garnish with the remaining spring onion.
usage:
  - serve with rice
notes:
  - We cooked this with prawns from frozen. The trick was we put the prawns BEFORE the galric and spring onion and let them cook on their own for a bit. Let them release water, drain it, then add more oil and the aromatics.
# TODO: this is a first.... do i wanna keep this?
