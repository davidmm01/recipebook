cuisine: italian
ingredients:
  - 6 carrots (~640g) chopped
  - 6 celery (~690g) chopped
  - 3 medium onions (~280g) chopped
  - 60ml EVOO
  - 1kg beef mince (10% fat)
  - 1kg pork mince (5% fat)
  - 2L passata
  - 2 cans crushed tomatos
  - 300g tomato paste
  - 1.5tsp white sugar
  - 1 good pinch MSG
  - 500ml red wine
  - salt and pepper
instructions:
  - Place a large pot  on medium heat, add EVOO and once warm, add onion. Cook until soft.
  - Add carrots and celery.  Leave to cook for 10 minutes.
  - Add 250ml of the red wine and leave to simmer on low until the alcohol evaporates.
  - Add the mince and break it down before seasoning with salt and pepper.
  - Leave mince to brown and excess water to evaporate.
  - Mix in the remaining 250ml of wine.
  - After allowing the wine to evaporate again, mix through the passata, tomato paste and peeled tomatoes.
  - After 1.5hr, add 1L water to the pot and mix through.
  - Then after another hour or so, add more. When the sauce looks dry, add water, this will thicken the mixture and allow the mince to become more tender.
  - Allow the sauce to bubble only a small amount and not spurt everywhere.
  - After around 4 or 5 hours, the sauce will be good. Season with salt.
usage:
  - string
notes:
  - Makes about 5.5kg of sugo
  - stir through a little bit of milk or cream before serving to make it delicious
next:
  - Add garlic
  - Add herbs
  - Less tomato paste
  - Try white wine like how mum does it, and maybe slightly less wine overall, seems like a lot
  - Try slightly higher fat pork, ad maybe adding a bit more oil
